# PoreScaleEletrode
This code generates synthetic 3-D pore-scale fiborous carbon electrodes for flow battery simulations.
This is a flexible 3-D pore-scale model that can generated synthetic electrode with varying parameters.
The adjustable paramters include:
  1. Computational domain size: depth, thickness and height.
  2. Electrode porosity, total fiber nubmer. 
  3. Single electrode fiber diameter, radius and curvature.
  4. Orientaions of the electrodes.
 The generated sythetic electrodes are exported as seperate STL file for each single electrode, which can be used for further electrode morphology modification.
